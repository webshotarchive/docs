# Github Action Credentials

This section of the tutorial will guide you through creating a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for the Webshot Archive API to use in Github Actions.

Next, you will use the [account page](https://www.webshotarchive.com/account#account-users) to create credentials for Github Actions to upload images and interact with the Webshot Archive API.

:::info
You will need to create an account on [webshotarchive.com](https://www.webshotarchive.com) to visit the account page. A freemium account is available with limited uploads per day.
:::

### Step 1 - Create a Service Account

Click the `Add User` button on the [account page](https://www.webshotarchive.com/account#account-users) as shown in the bottom right below.

When you create a new account for the first time, a service account user will be created for you and you can skip step 1 and 2.
