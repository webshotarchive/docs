# Uploading Screenshots from e2e tests

After setting up the API User ([Create Client Credentials](/docs/tutorial-basics/create-client-credentials)), GitHub Actions can capture screenshots with [Cypress](https://cypress.io/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), or other e2e testing tools. The Webshot Archive GitHub Action will upload the screenshots to the Webshot Archive API and comment on the Pull Request showing the image and diffs (if any).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled
- [Created Client Credentials](/docs/tutorial-basics/create-client-credentials) for the Webshot Archive API
- A project set up in the [Webshot Archive dashboard](https://www.webshotarchive.com/projects)
- Node.js and npm/pnpm installed locally

## What you'll learn

This tutorial will guide you through:

- Setting up Cypress to capture screenshots
- Running Cypress tests with GitHub Actions
- Configuring the Webshot Archive GitHub Action
- Validating screenshots on GitHub PRs
- Setting up automated screenshot comparison

## Quick Start

If you already have Cypress or another test runner configured, you can skip to [Step 7: Configure GitHub Actions](#step-7---configure-github-actions).

:::tip
For comparison screenshots, you need a main branch with screenshots already uploaded to the Webshot Archive API. Your first PR won't have comparisons, but after merging, future PRs will show diffs against the main branch.
:::

## Cypress Configuration

### Step 1 - Install Cypress

Install Cypress as a development dependency:

```bash
pnpm add -D cypress
```

:::note
This tutorial uses `pnpm` as the package manager. If you're using `npm`, replace `pnpm` with `npm` in all commands.
:::

### Step 2 - Initialize Cypress

Run the Cypress setup command to create the initial configuration:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will create a `cypress.config.ts` file and the necessary folder structure.

### Step 3 - Configure Cypress

Update your `cypress.config.ts` file:

```ts title="cypress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress';

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // Update to match your development server
    screenshotsFolder: 'dist/cypress',
    video: false, // Disable video recording to speed up tests
    viewportWidth: 1280,
    viewportHeight: 720,
  },
});
```

### Step 4 - Create a Test File

Create your first screenshot test:

```ts title="cypress/e2e/screenshots.cy.ts"
describe('Screenshot Tests', () => {
  it('should capture homepage screenshot', () => {
    cy.visit('/');

    // Wait for any animations or loading to complete
    cy.wait(1000);

    // Capture full page screenshot
    cy.screenshot('homepage', {
      capture: 'fullPage',
    });
  });

  it('should capture mobile viewport screenshot', () => {
    cy.viewport('iphone-x');
    cy.visit('/');

    cy.wait(1000);

    cy.screenshot('homepage-mobile', {
      capture: 'fullPage',
    });
  });
});
```

### Step 5 - Setup Build Scripts

Add the necessary scripts to your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "your-dev-server-command",
    "build": "your-build-command",
    "cypress:open": "cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "cypress run --e2e",
    "cypress:e2e": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 'cypress run --e2e'"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "cypress": "^13.0.0",
    "start-server-and-test": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

:::tip
The `start-server-and-test` package automatically starts your development server before running tests. Install it with `pnpm add -D start-server-and-test`.
:::

### Step 6 - Test Locally

Run your tests locally to verify everything works:

```bash
pnpm run cypress:e2e
```

After running, check that screenshots are generated in the `dist/cypress` folder. Add this folder to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore title=".gitignore"
# Cypress screenshots
dist/cypress/
cypress/screenshots/
cypress/videos/
```

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Step 7 - Configure GitHub Actions

Create two workflow files for handling screenshots on pull requests and main branch pushes.

> **Note:** You will need your `projectId` for the GitHub Action configuration.  
> You can retrieve your Project ID from the [Webshot Archive Projects page](https://webshotarchive.com/projects).  
> See the highlighted area in the screenshot below:

## Webshot Archive Github action

### Step 9 - Install the Github Action

In order for Webshot Archive to be able to comment on the PR you will need to [install the Webshot Archive GitHub Action](https://github.com/apps/webshot-archive-github-action/installations/new).
This gives Webshot Archive the following permissions:

- `Read and write access to pull requests`
- `Read access to metadata`

## Testing Your Setup

### Step 10 - Create a Test PR

1. Create a new branch and make a small change
2. Push the branch and create a pull request
3. The GitHub Action will automatically run and upload screenshots
4. Check the PR comments for screenshot results

### Expected Results

#### First PR (No Comparison)

Your first PR will show new screenshots without comparisons:

[![GitHub PR Screenshots](/img/screenshots/gha-screenshot-new.png)](/img/screenshots/gha-screenshot-new.png)

#### Subsequent PRs (With Comparison)

After merging your first PR, future PRs will show comparisons with the main branch:

<Image
  src="/img/screenshots/gha-screenshot-compare.png"
  alt="GitHub PR Diff"
  loading="eager"
/>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Screenshots not uploading:**

- Verify all GitHub secrets are correctly set
- Check that the `screenshotsFolder` path matches your Cypress configuration
- Ensure your project ID is correct in the Webshot Archive dashboard

**Tests failing in CI:**

- Add `continue-on-error: true` to the screenshot step to see results even if tests fail
- Check that your application builds and runs correctly in the CI environment
- Verify your `baseUrl` in Cypress config matches your CI setup

**No comparison screenshots:**

- Ensure the main branch workflow runs successfully after merging your first PR
- Check that the same `projectId` is used in both workflows
