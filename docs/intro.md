# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Webshot Archive**.

## Getting Started

Webshot Archive is a tool for capturing screenshots of your website and comparing them to previous screenshots. It is designed to work with Github Actions to capture screenshots of your website and upload them to the Webshot Archive API. Below is an example of what a comment looks like on a Github PR with the [Webshot Archive Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/webshot-archive-github-action).

It works by capturing screenshots of your website and uploading them to the Webshot Archive API. It uses [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) to compare screenshots and generate a diff. It then comments on the PR with the screenshots and a diff of the screenshots. You can also use the Webshot Archive UI to view the screenshots and diffs over time the same way you might view the history of a file in Github.
