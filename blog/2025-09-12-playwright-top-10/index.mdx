## #10: Test Reports and CI Integration

Playwright's reporting system provides comprehensive insights into your test execution, making it invaluable for both local development and CI/CD pipelines ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests#test-reports)).

The built-in HTML reporter offers rich visualizations including:

- Test execution timeline
- Screenshots and videos of failures
- Network request logs
- Console output capture

**CI Integration Made Easy:**

For GitHub Actions, you can preserve test artifacts with:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: ./playwright-report/
    retention-days: 30
```

**Pro Tip:** Enable reports in your `playwright.config.ts` for automatic generation:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['json', { outputFile: 'results.json' }],
  ],
});
```

## #9: Codegen - Automated Test Generation

Writing tests from scratch can be time-consuming. Playwright's codegen feature watches your browser interactions and generates test code automatically ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro#running-codegen)).

```bash
npx playwright codegen
```

![codegen](./assets/codegen.png)

**What makes it powerful:**

- **Language Support**: Generates code in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, or Java
- **Smart Selectors**: Creates robust locators that are less likely to break
- **Real-time Generation**: Watch code appear as you interact with the page
- **Custom URLs**: Start with `npx playwright codegen https://example.com`

**Best Practice:** Use codegen to bootstrap tests, then refine the generated code for better maintainability and add proper assertions.

## #8: Hosting Playwright Reports in the Cloud

Transform your test reports from local files into public, shareable dashboards using Azure Storage's static website hosting ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro#publishing-report-on-the-web)).

**Azure Storage Static Website Setup:**

1. **Create Azure Storage Account** with static website hosting enabled
2. **Set up Service Principal** with Storage Blob Data Contributor access:

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions" \
  --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
  --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets:**
   - `AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID`
   - `AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `AZCOPY_TENANT_ID`

4. **Add Upload Step to GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
- name: Upload HTML report to Azure
  shell: bash
  run: |
    REPORT_DIR='run-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}'
    azcopy cp --recursive "./playwright-report/*" "https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/\$web/$REPORT_DIR"
    echo "::notice title=HTML report url::https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.z1.web.core.windows.net/$REPORT_DIR/index.html"
  env:
    AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE: SPN
    AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID }}'
    AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET }}'
    AZCOPY_TENANT_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_TENANT_ID }}'
```

**Real-world Example:** Check out this [GitHub Action run](https://github.com/webshotarchive/docs/actions/runs/17671878545) that automatically deploys to this [hosted report](https://webshotarchiveplaywright.z13.web.core.windows.net/run-17671878545-1/index.html).

**Benefits:**

- Share results with stakeholders instantly
- Historical test trend analysis with unique URLs per run
- No local setup required for viewing reports
- Perfect for remote teams and CI/CD integration
- Cost-effective hosting solution

## #7: Advanced Debugging with Trace Viewer

When tests fail in CI but work locally, the Trace Viewer becomes your detective tool ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer)).

```bash
npx playwright show-trace path/to/trace.zip
```

**What you get:**

- **Complete Timeline**: Every action, assertion, and network request
- **DOM Snapshots**: See the exact page state at any point
- **Network Analysis**: Inspect requests, responses, and timing
- **Console Logs**: All browser console output captured
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of each step

**Enable tracing in your config:**

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry', // or 'retain-on-failure'
  },
});
```

**Pro Tip:** Use `trace: 'on'` during development and `trace: 'retain-on-failure'` in CI to balance performance with debugging capability.

## #6: VSCode Extension - IDE Integration

The official Playwright extension transforms VSCode into a powerful testing IDE ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode)).

**Key Features:**

- **Test Explorer**: Run individual tests or suites with one click
- **Interactive Debugging**: Set breakpoints and step through test code
- **Live Recording**: Record new tests directly in the editor
- **Pick Locator**: Click elements to generate selectors
- **Watch Mode**: Automatically re-run tests on file changes

**Installation:**

```bash
# Install from VSCode marketplace or
code --install-extension ms-playwright.playwright
```

**Why it's game-changing:** The seamless integration between test writing, debugging, and execution in a single environment dramatically speeds up development cycles.

## #5: Visual Regression Testing with toHaveScreenshot

Catch visual bugs before they reach production with Playwright's built-in screenshot comparison ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1)).

```ts
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('homepage.png');
```

**Advanced Options:**

```ts
await expect(page.locator('.hero-section')).toHaveScreenshot('hero.png', {
  threshold: 0.5, // 50% pixel difference tolerance
  maxDiffPixels: 100, // Maximum different pixels allowed
  animations: 'disabled', // Disable animations for consistent screenshots
});
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use `fullPage: true` for complete page captures
- Set consistent viewport sizes across environments
- Mask dynamic content like timestamps or user-specific data

## #4: Project Configuration for Multi-Environment Testing

Playwright projects allow you to run different test configurations simultaneously, perfect for testing across environments and browser configurations ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects)).

**Environment-Based Configuration:**

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'staging',
      use: {
        baseURL: 'https://staging.example.com',
      },
      testMatch: /.*smoke.spec.ts/,
      retries: 2,
    },
    {
      name: 'local',
      use: {
        baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
      },
      testIgnore: /.*smoke.spec.ts/,
      retries: 0,
    },
  ],
});
```

**Setup Dependencies for Authentication:**

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'setup',
      testMatch: '**/*.setup.ts',
    },
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },
  ],
});
```

**Run specific projects:**

```bash
npx playwright test --project=staging
```

## #3: Authentication and Session State Management

Eliminate repetitive login steps and speed up test execution with Playwright's authentication state management ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth)).

**Setup Authentication Once:**

```ts title="tests/auth.setup.ts"
import { test as setup, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import path from 'path';

const authFile = path.join(__dirname, '../playwright/.auth/user.json');

setup('authenticate', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
  await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill('username');
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('password');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

  await page.waitForURL('https://github.com/');
  await expect(
    page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })
  ).toBeVisible();

  // Save authentication state
  await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile });
});
```

**Use Saved State in Tests:**

```ts title="playwright.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    { name: 'setup', testMatch: /.*\.setup\.ts/ },
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        storageState: 'playwright/.auth/user.json',
      },
      dependencies: ['setup'],
    },
  ],
});
```

**Benefits:**

- Run authentication once, use across all tests
- Dramatically faster test execution
- Consistent authentication state
- Support for multiple user roles

## #2: Test Sharding for Massive Performance Gains

When you have hundreds or thousands of tests, sharding distributes them across multiple machines for parallel execution ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding)).

**Local Sharding:**

```bash
# Split tests across 4 processes
npx playwright test --shard=1/4 &
npx playwright test --shard=2/4 &
npx playwright test --shard=3/4 &
npx playwright test --shard=4/4 &
```

**GitHub Actions Matrix:**

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    shard: [1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4]
steps:
  - name: Run Playwright tests
    run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}
```

**Performance Impact:**

- **4x faster** test execution with 4 shards
- Linear scaling with more machines
- Automatic test distribution
- Perfect for large test suites in CI

**Best Practice:** Use sharding when your test suite takes more than 10-15 minutes to run sequentially.

## #1: UI Mode - The Ultimate Testing Experience

Playwright's UI Mode is a revolutionary testing interface that transforms how you develop, debug, and maintain tests ([docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode)).
