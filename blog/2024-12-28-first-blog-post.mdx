### About Webshot Archive

Some background on why I started Webshot Archive. I was building another side project
([Toshi Moto](https://github.com/toshimoto821/toshi-moto) - a watch only bitcoin wallet)
and wanted a better way to review and store cypress.io screenshots. Not finding any tools that fit my needs,
I did what any engineer would do. I built my own. Rather than build it into [Toshi Moto](https://github.com/toshimoto821/toshi-moto),
I decided to build it as a separate service. The three main features I wanted to achieve were:

- A private repository of application screenshots.
- A way to identify unexpected changes to your application.
- Watch and review changes to your application over time.

### About me

- For my day job I'm a Front End Engineer at a large company (not in any way affiliated with Webshot Archive).
- This is a side project that I'm working on in my free time.
- I use a pseudonym of Toshi Moto after Satoshi Nakamoto to maintain my privacy.
